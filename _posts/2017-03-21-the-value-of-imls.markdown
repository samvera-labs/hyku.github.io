At this moment in time, the Digital Public Library of America, Stanford University Libraries, and DuraSpace wish to express again our deep gratitude to the <a href="https://www.imls.gov/">Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS)</a> for generously funding the Hydra-in-a-Box project. As recipients of the largest IMLS award to date ($1M), these three diverse but mission-aligned organizations are able to create Hyku, a turnkey and open source software repository solution, now under development. Hyku will help institutions of all kinds and sizes by making it easier and more affordable to collect, manage, preserve, and make discoverable digital content such as publications, data and research outputs, and all manner of media collections. Our work on this technology aims to serve humanity by promoting research and learning in all disciplines, in all languages, in all corners of the globe. Preserving and promoting access to information makes possible new discoveries in the sciences, the humanities, and the arts. It is through such discoveries that we as a civilization attain a greater understanding of the human condition, that we are able to cure disease and prolong lives, that we can protect the vitality of our planet, that we build cultural awareness and harmony, enriching our collective experience. 

The potential to create and discover starts with opportunity. Thank you, IMLS, for providing us -- and so many other beneficiaries of your programs -- the opportunity to play a participatory role in this truly human endeavor.
